ehri_statistics
===============

scripts to run on the ehri neo4j graph, to obtain some numbers on repositories, countries, descriptions etc.

you might need to install some python libraries, for instance 'requests':
```
    sudo pip install requests
```

run the python file with the '-h' option to see the help.

for now, all output is written into one (1) file, with multiple parts.
